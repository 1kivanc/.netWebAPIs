## .Net Web API's

### 1) Employee Api
This is my first .net api, I created a simple Employee API that allows you to add, update, and manage employees. For this project, I used DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) like AddEmployeeDto and UpdateEmployeeDto to handle the data more efficiently.

### 2) Video Game Api(Dapper)
